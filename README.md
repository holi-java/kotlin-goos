# GOOS

## Incremental Development

- how to slice up the functionality so that it can be built a little at a time?
  - each slice should be significant and concrete enough so that the team can tell when it's done.
  - each slice should be small enough to be focused on one concept and achievable quickly.

### Benefit

- dividing the work into small, conherent chunks helps us manage the development risk.
- we get regular, concrete feedback on the progress we'are making, so we can adjust your plan as the team discovers more about the domain and the technologies.
